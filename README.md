React Redux is the official binding for using Redux with React. It helps manage application state efficiently by providing tools like useSelector and useDispatch, making it easier to access and update the store in a React app.

Your project effectively demonstrates state management using React Redux Toolkit. It includes three buttons:

1️⃣ Increment Button – Increases the count.

2️⃣ Decrement Button – Decreases the count.

3️⃣ Custom Increment Button with Input – Allows the user to specify how much to increment.

It also dynamically updates and calculates the count based on user interactions. 🚀
